Facing Software
===============

*In this version of face.py the Lead-in, lead-out value is replaced by 
separate Xoffset and Yoffset values, making it a bit more flexible for 
other routers, like my grbl based CNC router. *

*The code seems to work for me, but User Interface and documentation are
not updated yet.*

**Download:** [face.py](https://github.com/linuxcnc/simple-gcode-generators/raw/master/face/face.py)
